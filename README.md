Arbitrage Pricing Theory Models, Mixed-effects Models and Reinforcement Learning application in active portfolio management (Python)

Arbitrage Pricing Theory Models :  
• Given stocks factors, including style, alpha, and industry factors data and stocks returns data from 2007 to 2017, computed factor returns using regression method with OLS and Weighted-least-squares (WLS)  
• Construct constrained and unconstrained Markowitz portfolio by mean-variance optimization, calculated transaction cost using simple market impact model, and conduct risk attribution

Mixed-effect Model :  
• Estimate the parameters of the factor-return process using a linear mixed-effects (LME) model and utilize EM algorithm in solving linear mixed-effect model


Reinforcement Learning:  
• Designed and implemented reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to exploit arbitrage opportunities in a simulated market system
